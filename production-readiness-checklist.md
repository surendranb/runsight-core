### 2. **Environmental Analysis - Pace Display Bug**
- **Status**: 🔴 **BROKEN** 
- **Issue**: Performance by temperature showing "--:--/km" instead of actual pace averages
- **Impact**: Core feature displays meaningless data
- **Priority**: P0 - Blocks launch
- **Fix Required**: Fix pace calculation/formatting in environmental analysis

### 3. **Race Predictions - Inconsistent CTL/TSB Values**
- **Status**: 🟡 **INCONSISTENT**
- **Issue**: CTL shows "0" in Race Predictions but "1540" in Training Load dashboard
- **Impact**: Confusing user experience, undermines prediction accuracy
- **Priority**: P1 - High
- **Fix Required**: Ensure consistent data flow between components

### 4. **User Physiological Profile Setup - Missing Interface**
- **Status**: 🔴 **MISSING**

- **Impact**: Advanced metrics rely on estimated values, reducing accuracy
- **Priority**: P1 - High
- **Fix Required**: Implement profile setup wizard/form

### 5. **Weekly TRIMP Chart - All Zero Values**
- **Status**: 🟡 **DATA ISSUE**
- **Issue**: Chart shows all "0" values despite individual runs having TRIMP scores
- **Impact**: Training load trends not visible
- **Priority**: P1 - High
- **Fix Required**: Fix weekly aggregation calculation

### 6. **Power Estimation - No Data Display**
- **Status**: 🟡 **INCOMPLETE**
- **Issue**: Power column shows "-" for all runs despite having estimation logic
- **Impact**: Missing feature that users expect
- **Priority**: P1 - High
- **Fix Required**: Enable power calculation and display
